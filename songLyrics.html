<h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
<p> Stand up straight now(oh oh oh oh) </p>
<p> Can't break down (oh oh oh oh)</p>
<p> Graduate now (oh oh oh oh)</p>
<P>I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here</P>
<p>It's a taste test (oh oh oh oh)</p>
<p> Of what I hate less (oh oh oh oh oh)</p>
<p> can you die of anxiousness? ( oh oh oh)</p>
<p>I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here</p>
<p>what's about to happen? What's about to happen?</p>

<h4>[Chorus]</h4>
<p>I remember, I remember certain things</p>
<p> What I was wearing, the yellow dashes in the street</p>
<p> I prayed those lights would take me home</p>
<p> Then I heard <em> " Hey, Kid, get out of the road!"</em></p>
<h4> [Post-Chorus]</h4>
<p> (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh oh oh oh)</p>
<p> I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here</p>
<h4> [Verse 2]</h4>
<p> I can't feel my legs (oh oh oh)</p>
<p> I might suffocate (oh oh oh oh)</p>
<p> There's a pressure in my chest ( oh oh oh)</p>
<p> I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here</p>
<p> What's about to happen? What's about to happen?</p>
